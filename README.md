## :lemon: Usage

I recommend installing the tool globally, so that you can make use of it no matter what project you're working on, but you can take out -g flag if you want to use it in particular projects instead:
```sh
npm i -g css-learner
```

The default language is determined by the node environment.Then, to kick off the explorer, type:
```sh
css
```

Use the Chinese version of the CSS terminal tool
```sh
csscn
```
Use the English version of the CSS terminal tool
```sh
cssen
```

The CSS resource comes from the MDN documentation
